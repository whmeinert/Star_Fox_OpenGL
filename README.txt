FP: There and Back Again

This program allows the user to control the arwing ship around scene while trying to avoid getting hit by the enemies by
either shooting them with the lasers or by moving out of the way.  The program uses a cartoon shader to shade the ship,
ground and sky and the enemies are rendered using a glitch shader to give them their look.  The lasers are also point
lights and illuminate the surrounding scene.

WASD moves up, down, left, right, E to fire lasers, 1 for Third person, 2 for first person, 0 to unlock third person cam

Easter Egg:
pressing up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, A, B (using arrows keys for directions) will make the ship "do a barrel roll!"

No special instructions for compiling code.

No bugs that we know about

We load in obj and mtl files for models and bmp and png files for textures

this assignment took us around 15 combined hours of work

7/10 the labs were very helpful in giving us the base knowledge of how to do all the things we implemented in this project

8/10, It was super fun to put all the stuff we have learned to create this one large project.
