A4 - Off to Never Never Land

This program draws my character with a BÃ©zier curve drawn around them with a small object that flies along the curve

WASD to move, ZX to tilt up and down, C turns cage and points off, V turn Curve off, B switches between arc length parameterization

No special instructions for compiling

I had some trouble getting the small character to point at the curve while flying around, so I tried to get as close as I
could, but it is slightly wonky

This assignment took me around 3 hours

7/10 I think we could have used a little more explanation on how to do sky boxes, I know we should use cube maps, but I have no idea how

7/10 I liked making the curve and my small little world
